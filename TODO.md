# Roadmap & Future Ideas

This is a list of features and improvements I'm considering for future versions of SomaTUI.

## Features

- [ ] Implement desktop notifications for song changes.
- [ ] Implement an MPRIS interface for Linux for better desktop integration.
- [ ] Add support for hardware media keys (play/pause, etc.).

## Packaging & Installation

- [ ] Create and publish packages for various operating systems and package managers (e.g., Homebrew, AUR, .deb, .rpm).

## Architecture

- [ ] Split the software into a UI client and a server component.
